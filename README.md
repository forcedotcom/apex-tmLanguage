## Development

To **build and test** install Node.js do the following:

* Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.
* Run `gulp` to build and run tests.

Output grammars are output in the `grammars\` dirctory.

On Windows you may see a node-gyp error - [follow the instrutions here to resolve it](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/README.md).

### Adding grammas rules

Token structure is based off of [Textmate's Language Grammar guidelines](https://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars)

## Supported outputs

* `grammars\apex.tmLanguage.cson` - for Atom
* `grammars\apex.tmLanguage` - TextMate grammar (XML plist)
